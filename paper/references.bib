	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching scientific and translational implications. State-of-the-art alignment-based techniques cannot predict function for one-third of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit data from diverse organisms. Here, we train deep learning models to accurately predict functional annotations for unaligned amino acid sequences across rigorous benchmark assessments built from the 17,929 families of the protein families database Pfam. The models infer known patterns of evolutionary substitutions and learn representations that accurately cluster sequences from unseen families. Combining deep models with existing methods significantly improves remote homology detection, suggesting that the deep models learn complementary information. This approach extends the coverage of Pfam by {\textgreater}9.5\%, exceeding additions made over the last decade, and predicts function for 360 human reference proteome proteins with no previous Pfam annotation. These results suggest that deep learning models will be a core component of future protein annotation tools.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {We computationally predict operons in the Synechococcus sp. {WH}8102 genome based on three types of genomic data: intergenic distances, {COG} gene functions and phylogenetic profiles. In the proposed method, we first estimate a log-likelihood distribution for each type of genomic data, and then fuse these distribution information by a perceptron to discriminate pairs of genes within operons ({WO} pairs) from those across transcription unit borders ({TUB} pairs). Computational experiments demonstrated that {WO} pairs tend to have shorter intergenic distances, a higher probability being in the same {COG} functional categories and more similar phylogenetic profiles than {TUB} pairs, indicating their powerful capabilities for operon prediction. By testing the method on 236 known operons of Escherichia coli K12, an overall accuracy of 83.8\% is obtained by joint learning from multiple types of genomic data, whereas individual information source yields accuracies of 80.4\%, 74.4\%, and 70.6\% respectively. We have applied this new approach, in conjunction with our previous comparative genome analysis-based approach, to predict 556 (putative) operons in {WH}8102.

We have predicted operons in P.furiosus by combining the results from three existing algorithms using a neural network ({NN}). These algorithms use intergenic distances, phylogenetic profiles, functional categories and gene-order conservation in their operon prediction. Our method takes as inputs the confidence scores of the three programs, and outputs a prediction of whether adjacent genes on the same strand belong to the same operon. In addition, we have applied Gene Ontology ({GO}) and {KEGG} pathway information to improve the accuracy of our algorithm. The parameters of this {NN} predictor are trained on a subset of all experimentally verified operon gene pairs of Bacillus subtilis. It subsequently achieved 86.5\% prediction accuracy when applied to a subset of gene pairs for Escherichia coli, which is substantially better than any of the three prediction programs. Using this new algorithm, we predicted 470 operons in the P.furiosus genome. Of these, 349 were validated using {DNA} microarray data.},

	abstract = {The operon is a specific functional organization of genes found in bacterial genomes. Most genes within operons share common features. The support vector machine ({SVM}) approach is here used to predict operons at the genomic level. Four features were chosen as {SVM} input vectors: the intergenic distances, the number of common pathways, the number of conserved gene pairs and the mutual information of phylogenetic profiles. The analysis reveals that these common properties are indeed characteristic of the genes within operons and are different from that of non-operonic genes. Jackknife testing indicates that these input feature vectors, employed with {RBF} kernel {SVM}, achieve high accuracy. To validate the method, Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis were taken as benchmark genomes of known operon structure, and the prediction results in both show that the {SVM} can detect operon genes in target genomes efficiently and offers a satisfactory balance between sensitivity and specificity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analyses have led to a number of new insights about operon prediction, including that (i) different features have different levels of discerning power when used on adjacent gene pairs with different ranges of intergenic distance, (ii) certain features are universally useful for operon prediction while others are more genome-specific and (iii) the prediction reliability of operons is dependent on intergenic distances. Based on these new insights, our newly developed operon-prediction program achieves more accurate operon prediction than the previous ones, and it uses features that are most readily available from genomic sequences. Our prediction results indicate that our (non-linear) decision tree-based classifier can predict operons in a prokaryotic genome very accurately when a substantial number of operons in the genome are already known. For example, the prediction accuracy of our program can reach 90.2 and 93.7\% on Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli genomes, respectively. When no such information is available, our (linear) logistic function-based classifier can reach the prediction accuracy at 84.6 and 83.3\% for E.coli and B.subtilis, respectively.},

The algorithm relies on the fact that enzyme genes in operons tend to catalyze successive reactions in metabolic pathways. We applied this algorithm to 42 microbial genomes to identify putative operon structures. The predicted operons from Escherichia coli were compared with a selected metabolism-related operon dataset from the {RegulonDB} database, yielding a prediction sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (87\%) relative to this dataset. Several examples of detected operons are given and analyzed. Modular gene cluster transfer and operon fusion are observed. A further use of predicted operon data to assign function to putative genes was suggested and, as an example, a previous putative gene ({MJ}1604) from Methanococcus jannaschii is now annotated as a phosphofructokinase, which was regarded previously as a missing enzyme in this organism. {GC} content changes in the operon region and nonoperon region were examined. The results reveal a clear {GC} content transition at the boundaries of putative operons. We looked further into the conservation of operons across genomes.

The current strongest operon predictor depends on the distributions of intergenic distances ({IGD}) separating adjacent genes within and between operons. Unfortunately, experimental data on these distance distributions are limited to Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We suggest a new graph algorithmic approach based on comparative genomics to identify clusters of conserved genes independent of {IGD} and conservation of gene order. As a consequence, distance distributions of operon pairs for any arbitrary prokaryotic genome can be inferred. For E.coli, the algorithm predicts 854 conserved adjacent pairs with a precision of 85\%. The {IGD} distribution for these pairs is virtually identical to the E.coli operon pair distribution. Statistical analysis of the predicted pair {IGD} distribution allows estimation of a genome-specific operon {IGD} cut-off, obviating the requirement for a training set in {IGD}-based operon prediction. We apply the method to a representative set of eight genomes, and show that these genome-specific {IGD} distributions differ considerably from each other and from the distribution in E.coli.},

As experimental methods for the detection of operons are difficult and time-consuming, efforts are being put into developing computational methods that can use available biological information to predict operons.
{METHOD}: A genetic algorithm is developed to evolve a starting population of putative operon maps of the genome into progressively better predictions. Fuzzy scoring functions based on multiple criteria are used for assessing the 'fitness' of the newly evolved operon maps and guiding their evolution.
{RESULTS}: The algorithm organizes the whole genome into operons. The fuzzy guided genetic algorithm-based approach makes it possible to use diverse biological information like genome sequence data, functional annotations and conservation across multiple genomes, to guide the organization process. This approach does not require any prior training with experimental operons. The predictions from this algorithm for Escherchia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis are evaluated against experimentally discovered operons for these organisms. The accuracy of the method is evaluated using an {ROC} (receiver operating characteristic) analysis. The area under the {ROC} curve is around 0.9, which indicates excellent accuracy.

As far as we know, these are the highest accuracies ever obtained for predicting bacterial operons. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the predictable accuracy of our model when using an organism's data set for the training procedure, and a different organism's data set for testing, we repeated the E. coli operon prediction analysis using a neural network trained with B. subtilis data, and a B. subtilis analysis using a neural network trained with E. coli data. Even for these cases, the accuracies reached with our method were outstandingly high, 91.5 and 93\%, respectively.

While there are a growing number of organisms whose sequence and gene coordinates are known, by and large their operons are not known.
{RESULTS}: We present a probabilistic approach to predicting operons using Bayesian networks. Our approach exploits diverse evidence sources such as sequence and expression data. We evaluate our approach on the Escherichia coli K-12 genome where our results indicate we are able to identify over 78\% of its operons at a 10\% false positive rate. Also, empirical evaluation using a reduced set of data sources suggests that our approach may have significant value for organisms that do not have as rich of evidence sources as E.coli.

	abstract = {Motivation: Annotation of operons in a bacterial genome is an important step in determining an organism's transcriptional regulatory program. While extensive studies of operon structure have been carried out in a few species such as Escherichia coli, fewer resources exist to inform operon prediction in newly sequenced genomes. In particular, many extant operon finders require a large body of training examples to learn the properties of operons in the target organism. For newly sequenced genomes, such examples are generally not available; moreover, a model of operons trained on one species may not reflect the properties of other, distantly related organisms. We encountered these issues in the course of predicting operons in the genome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B.theta), a common anaerobe that is a prominent component of the normal adult human intestinal microbial community.Results: We describe an operon predictor designed to work without extensive training data. We rely on a small set of a priori assumptions about the properties of the genome being annotated that permit estimation of the probability that two adjacent genes lie in a common operon. Predictions integrate several sources of information, including intergenic distance, common functional annotation and a novel formulation of conserved gene order. We validate our predictor both on the known operons of E.coli and on the genome of B.theta, using expression data to evaluate our predictions in the latter.Availability: The software is available online at http://www.cse.wustl.edu/{\textasciitilde}jbuhler/research/{operonsContact}:jbuhler@cse.wustl.edu},

Recently, a novel genetic program denominated the {CRISPR}/Cas system was demonstrated to have a role in these biological processes providing genetic immunity. This defense mechanism is widespread in the Archaea and Bacteria, suggesting an ancient origin. In the last few years, progress has been made regarding the functionality of the {CRISPR}/Cas system; however, many basic aspects of the system remain unknown. For instance, there are few studies about the conditions and regulators involved in its transcriptional control. In this work, we analyzed the transcriptional organization of the {CRISPR}/Cas system as well as the positive and negative regulators involved in its genetic expression in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The results obtained show that in S. Typhi the {CRISPR}/Cas system is a {LeuO}-dependent operon silenced by the global regulator {LRP}, in addition to the previously known nucleoid-associated protein H-{NS}; both {LRP} and H-{NS} bind upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site of {casA}. In this study, relevant nucleotides of the {casA} regulatory region that mediate its {LeuO} transcriptional activation were identified. Interestingly, specific growth conditions (N-minimal medium) were found for the {LeuO}-independent expression of the {CRISPR}/Cas system in S. Typhi. Thus, our work provides evidence that there are multiple modulators involved in the genetic expression of this immune system in S. Typhi {IMSS}-1.},

Resistance mechanisms include enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic (penicillinase and aminoglycoside-modification enzymes), alteration of the target with decreased affinity for the antibiotic (notable examples being penicillin-binding protein 2a of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and D-Ala-D-Lac of peptidoglycan precursors of vancomycin-resistant strains), trapping of the antibiotic (for vancomycin and possibly daptomycin) and efflux pumps (fluoroquinolones and tetracycline). Complex genetic arrays (staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec elements or the {vanA} operon) have been acquired by S. aureus through horizontal gene transfer, while resistance to other antibiotics, including some of the most recent ones (e.g., fluoroquinolones, linezolid and daptomycin) have developed through spontaneous mutations and positive selection.

Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named {DNABERT}, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic {DNA} sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared {DNABERT} to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, {DNABERT} enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained {DNABERT} with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained {DNABERT} model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for {DNABERT} are available at {GitHub} (https://github.com/jerryji1993/{DNABERT}).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Our predictive model was successfully tested on the set of experimentally defined operons in E. coli and B. subtilis , with accuracies of 94.6 and 93.3\%, respectively. As far as we know, these are the highest accuracies ever obtained for predicting bacterial operons. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the predictable accuracy of our model when using an organism's data set for the training procedure, and a different organism's data set for testing, we repeated the E. coli operon prediction analysis using a neural network trained with B. subtilis data, and a B. subtilis analysis using a neural network trained with E. coli data. Even for these cases, the accuracies reached with our method were outstandingly high, 91.5 and 93\%, respectively.

It weights and integrates information from numerous sources, including experimental repositories, computational prediction methods and public text collections, thus acting as a meta-database that maps all interaction evidence onto a common set of genomes and proteins. The most important new developments in {STRING} 8 over previous releases include a {URL}-based programming interface, which can be used to query {STRING} from other resources, improved interaction prediction via genomic neighborhood in prokaryotes, and the inclusion of protein structures. Version 8.0 of {STRING} covers about 2.5 million proteins from 630 organisms, providing the most comprehensive view on protein–protein interactions currently available. {STRING} can be reached at http://string-db.org/.},

	abstract = {A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. {STRING} aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. {STRING} integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. {STRING} currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385},
	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	abstract = {Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with high incidence, high mortality, and high disability rate. Determining the location and volume of the disease in {MR} images promotes accurate stroke diagnosis and surgical planning. Therefore, the automatic recognition and segmentation of stroke lesions has important clinical significance for large-scale stroke imaging analysis. There are some problems in the segmentation of stroke lesions, such as imbalance of the front and back scenes, uncertainty of position, and unclear boundary. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a cross-attention and deep supervision {UNet} ({CADS}-{UNet}) to segment chronic stroke lesions from T1-weighted {MR} images. Specifically, we propose a cross-spatial attention module, which is different from the usual self-attention module. The location information interactively selects encode features and decode features to enrich the lost spatial focus. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is used to screen the channel characteristics. Finally, combined with deep supervision and mixed loss, the model is supervised more accurately. We compared and verified the model on the authoritative open dataset “Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke” (Atlas), which fully proved the effectiveness of our model.},

In this paper, we leverage the neural transformer architectures for multi-channel speech recognition systems, where the spectral and spatial information collected from different microphones are integrated using attention layers. Our multi-channel transformer network mainly consists of three parts: channel-wise self attention layers ({CSA}), cross-channel attention layers ({CCA}), and multi-channel encoder-decoder attention layers ({EDA}). The {CSA} and {CCA} layers encode the contextual relationship within and between channels and across time, respectively. The channel-attended outputs from {CSA} and {CCA} are then fed into the {EDA} layers to help decode the next token given the preceding ones. The experiments show that in a far-field in-house dataset, our method outperforms the baseline single-channel transformer, as well as the super-directive and neural beamformers cascaded with the transformers.},

	abstract = {Medical image segmentation remains particularly challenging for complex and low-contrast anatomical structures. In this paper, we introduce the U-Transformer network, which combines a U-shaped architecture for image segmentation with self- and cross-attention from Transformers. U-Transformer overcomes the inability of U-Nets to model long-range contextual interactions and spatial dependencies, which are arguably crucial for accurate segmentation in challenging contexts. To this end, attention mechanisms are incorporated at two main levels: a self-attention module leverages global interactions between encoder features, while cross-attention in the skip connections allows a fine spatial recovery in the U-Net decoder by filtering out non-semantic features. Experiments on two abdominal {CT}-image datasets show the large performance gain brought out by U-Transformer compared to U-Net and local Attention U-Nets. We also highlight the importance of using both self- and cross-attention, and the nice interpretability features brought out by U-Transformer.},
